### Tech Stack
My last capstone will be built with React and Node, the most recent languages learned. The goal is to create a full-stack application, showcasing my skills for front and backend development. 

### The Goal 
This will be a website showing off famous quotes. Users when not signed in, will be able to browse famous quotes, and see a quote of the day. When signed in, users can create their own posts for quotes, and view quotes other users have posted. 

### The Demographic
This website can really be used by anyone seeking to gain some inspiration from famous poems, speeches, or sayings.

### Data
I may be using more than one API, because there are a couple APIs that offer famous quotes that I like. They could be used to select random quotes, show famous quotes. The area where users can post their own quotes will be calling from my own API, at least to start off with. 

### Database Schema
The database schema will need to have tables for the user, and the user quotes. 
Each tab will allow the user to view different things like famous quotes, or user quotes, or the Quote of the Day.

### Potential API issues
The APIs I found have a searching capability, that will allow for a user to search for quotes by a certain author. I have not been able to successfully use that when testing my API in Insomnia/Postman. It's like the method doesn't work the way they advertise it to do so.

### Stretch Goals
It would be great, with time permitting, to have a "like" capability for all the quotes. Since it is not the same as "favorting" an item like I attempted in my last capstone, this will be a new (and challenging) learning opportunity.
